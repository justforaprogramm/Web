      <h3>ISO/OSI:</h3>
    <p>
        This model is a 7-layer reference model that was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) <br>
        and is developed for open System Interconnection (OSI) to explain how information is transmitted over a network. <br>
        The model defines seven abstract layers, each with specific responsibilities, that data must pass through in order to be transmitted over a network.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>division:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Physical Layer - responsible for transmitting bits over a physical medium</li>
        <li>Data Link Layer - responsible for transmitting data frames over a network</li>
        <li>Network Layer - responsible for transmitting packets over a network</li>
        <li>Transport Layer - responsible for reliable data transfer between devices</li>
        <li>Session Layer - responsible for managing sessions between applications</li>
        <li>Presentation Layer - responsible for formatting data for presentation to the application layer</li>
        <li>Application Layer - responsible for presenting data to the user and facilitating communication between applications</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>communication prozess:</h3>
    <p>
        The ISO/OSI model plays a crucial role in the communication process between two computers.<br>
         It provides a standardized framework for the development and implementation of network protocols. <br>
         The model is composed of seven layers, each with its own specific function and responsibilities.<br>
          The layers work together to ensure that data is transmitted reliably and efficiently across a network. <br>
          The model allows for different hardware and software to work together seamlessly. <br>
          It enables communication between different types of devices, operating systems, and network technologies. <br>
          The model also facilitates troubleshooting and fault isolation by dividing complex network processes into simpler, more manageable tasks.<br>
           Overall, the ISO/OSI model is essential for ensuring interoperability and efficient communication between computers and networks.<br>
