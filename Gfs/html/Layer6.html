        The sixth layer of the OSI model is known as the Presentation layer. <br>
        This layer is responsible for formatting and presenting data in a way that can be understood <br>
        by the receiving device. The Presentation layer takes care of tasks such as data encryption, <br>
        compression, and data conversion. It ensures that the data is presented in a format<br>
         that is independent of the application, operating system, or network architecture. <br>
         The Presentation layer also handles the translation of character sets and code pages, <br>
         which is crucial for applications that operate across different countries and regions.<br>
          Overall, the Presentation layer plays a critical role in ensuring that the data is transmitted correctly<br>
           between devices and that it can be understood by the receiving application.
