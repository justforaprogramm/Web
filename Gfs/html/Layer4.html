        Fourth Layer The transport layer facilitates the transfer <br>
        of variable-length data sequences from a source host to a destination host across a network,<br>
        while ensuring quality-of-service functions. <br>
        This involves breaking down large protocol data units or long data streams into smaller segments <br>
        due to the maximum packet size imposed by the network layer,<br>
        called the maximum transmission unit (MTU). <br>
        The amount of data in a segment must be small enough to allow for a network-layer header <br>
        and a transport-layer header. The transport layer controls the reliability <br>
        of a given link between the source and destination hosts through flow control, <br>
        error control, and acknowledgments of sequence and existence. <br>
        Some protocols are state- and connection-oriented, <br>
        allowing the transport layer to keep track of segments and retransmit those that fail delivery. <br>
        However, protocols like UDP are used in applications that can tolerate some packet loss, <br>
        reordering, errors, or duplication. <br>
        The OSI connection-oriented transport protocol defines five classes <br>
        of connection-mode transport protocols ranging from TP0 to TP4, <br>
        with TP0 providing the fewest features and TP4 being the most reliable. <br>
        The transport layer can be compared to a post office that deals with the dispatch <br>
        and classification of mail and parcels sent. <br>
        Tunnelling protocols operate at the transport layer, <br>
        such as carrying non-IP protocols or end-to-end encryption with IPsec.<br>
         While GRE might seem like a network-layer protocol, <br>
         it becomes closer to a transport protocol when encapsulation of the payload takes place only <br>
         at the endpoint. L2TP carries PPP frames inside transport segments.<br>
