        The model distinguishes between the media Layer 1 to 3 and the host Layer 5 to 7.<br>
        However, you might wonder where Layer 4 fits in. actually nowhere. <br>
        Layer 4 acts as the "glue" that holds both structures together. <br>
        This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between different hosts<br>
        and manages the reliability and integrity of data transmission. <br>
        It plays a crucial role in ensuring that data is sent and received accurately and efficiently. <br>
        In summary, while Layers 1 to 3 deal with the physical aspects of data transmission,<br>
         Layers 4 to 7 focus on the application-level aspects of communication. <br>
         One of the benefits of the ISO OSI model's classification of the layers into media layers<br>
          and host layers is that it helps to provide a clear separation of concerns. <br>
          This means that each layer is responsible for performing specific functions <br>
          that contribute to the overall communication process, <br>
          and that the layers are not overly dependent on each other. For example, <br>
          the media layers are responsible for handling the physical aspects of data transmission, <br>
          while the host layers are responsible for handling the logical aspects of data transmission.<br>
           This clear separation of concerns helps to make the communication process more efficient and reliable.
